    @main explores the cave, holding their &light high. It's a lot deeper than they@main thought.
    While @main explores the cave, their &light flickers for a moment.
    @main's steps echo across a huge section of the cave. Not even their &light can illuminate the ceiling.

    While wandering through the depths of the cave, @main comes across a sudden and steep drop. Peering down it, they@main aren't@main sure how deep it is.
  -> climb:
    main: item climb climbing
    text: |
      They@main use@main their@main &climb to descend the drop. At the bottom is a chest!

      main: createnamed udjat Udjat Eye, limittotal 1; give udjat

        @main opens it to find a sort of relic, ornately carved and vividly painted. It seems very important. They@main decide@main to take it with them@main, returning up the steep hole.
    -> default:
      main: create loot currency, create loot2 currency; give loot, give loot2
      text: |
        @main opens it to find a&loot and a&loot2. They@main take@main both and climb@main back up.

      They@main don't@main really have the equipment to go further, so they@main turn back. There's plenty of cave to explore anyway.

    @main sees something shiny in the wall.
  -> gem:
    main: item pick smashing, create loot currency; give loot
    text: |
      They@main break it out with their@main &pick, and it turns out to be a&loot!
  -> other:
    main: item pick smashing, create loot utility; give loot
    text: |
      They@main break it out with their@main &pick, and are surprised to find a&loot of all things!

    text: |
      At least now they@main know@main there's treasure to be had in this cave.

give:
  main: create dig smashing
  text: |
    Something catches @main's eye as they're@main spelunking. There's a&dig lying on the ground!
  -> leave:
    main: item theirs smashing
    text: |
      They@main already have a&theirs, though. They leave it behind.
  -> default:
    main: ; give dig
    text: |
      It's definitely a useful tool to have in a cave. They@main take@main it with them@main.

give climbing:
  main: create climb climbing; give climb
  text: |
    @main finds a&climb as they're@main wandering through the cave. They@main decide@main to take it with them@main.

    @main finds their way back out of the Caves.
